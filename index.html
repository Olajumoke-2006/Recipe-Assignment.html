      <!-- Steps for the Chicken -->
      <li><strong>Prepare the chicken:</strong> Pat chicken dry with paper towels. Season with salt, pepper, garlic powder and ginger.</li>
      <li>In a large pot, heat ¼ cup of vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Add the sliced onion and sauté.</li>
      <li>Add the seasoned chicken pieces to the pan and brown on all sides (about 5–7 minutes per side). Once browned, remove the chicken and set aside.</li>
      <li><strong>Make the base sauce for the rice:</strong> In the same pan (or a separate large, deep pot), add a little more oil if needed. Sauté the chopped onion until soft, then add the minced garlic, chopped tomatoes, and red bell pepper.</li>
      <li>Add the tomato paste, stirring frequently to prevent burning. Let it fry for a few minutes until the paste becomes sweet and fragrant.</li>
      <li>Season the sauce with thyme, curry powder, salt, and pepper. Stir thoroughly so all the flavors combine.</li>
      <li>Add the rice to the sauce, stirring to coat every grain in the tomato-pepper mixture.</li>
      <li>Pour in the chicken stock (or water) and add the bay leaf. Stir gently, bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.</li>
      <li>Cover the pot and cook the rice for about 20–25 minutes, checking occasionally to ensure it’s not burning. If needed, add a little more stock/water.</li>
      <li>While the rice is cooking, return the browned chicken to the pot, adding it into the rice so it finishes cooking with the rice.</li>
      <li>When the rice is tender and the chicken is fully cooked, remove from heat. Let it rest and cover for 5–10 minutes.</li>
      <li>Fluff the rice gently with a fork, remove the bay leaf, and serve the jollof rice together with the chicken.</li>
    </ol>

  <!-- Tips -->

    <ul>
    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <li><p> Use parboiled rice for better texture.</p></li>
    <li><p>You can adjust the heat by adding more pepper if you prefer a <strong>spicier</strong> jollof.</p></li> 
    <li>For a smokier flavor, try “party jollof” by allowing the rice to stick slightly to the base for a few minutes before serving.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h3><p><strong>Note:</strong> If the sauce becomes too thick before adding rice, you can dilute it slightly with warm stock or water.</p></h3>
